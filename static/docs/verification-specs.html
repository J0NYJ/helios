<h1 id="title">Helios Verification Specifications</h1>
by Ben Adida.
<hr />

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    Helios is an open-audit voting system, which means that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Alice can verify that her vote was correctly captured,</li>
    <li> all captured votes are displayed (in encrypted form) for all to see, and</li>
    <li> anyone can verify that the captured votes were correctly tallied.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This document specifies all data formats and the exact verification protocols and algorithms. Using this document, it should be possible for an able programmer to build a complete verification program in any modern programming language. For the sake of concreteness, each step in this document is illustrated using Python (2.3 or above.)
</p>

<h3>Data Formats</h3>

<p>
    We begin with a description of the data types and their representations. All data made available by Helios is in <a href="http://json.org">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a> format, with keys in <u>alphabetical order</u> and <u>no extraneous whitespace</u> other than that specified by JSON. These two conditions are particularly important, as hashing data structures will only yield the same hash if the conditions are respected. An example of a JSON data structure with these two conditions is:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">{"email": ["ben@adida.net", "ben@mit.edu"], "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Adida"}
</div>

<h4>Basic Cryptographic Datatypes</h4>

<p>
    All large integers are represented in decimal form as strings, rather than integers. (The reason is that some languages do not support big integers natively, and thus cannot properly parse large integers in JSON integer form.) For example:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">{"p": "109123071234023421012301240124234023423432423432232502523078237423"}</div>

<p>
    An El-Gamal public-key is then a dictionary including the prime <tt>p</tt>, the primer-order <tt>q</tt> of its intended subgroup, the generator <tt>g</tt>, and the public-key value <tt>y</tt> (but of course with keys in alphabetical order):
</p>

<div class="codeblock">{"g": "6811145128679259384514506369165", "p": "16998971978194099593503959",
"q": "8499485989097049796751", "y": "7464668703479877164253720373259704"}</div>

<p>
    An El-Gamal ciphertext is a JSON structure containing properties <tt>alpha</tt> and <tt>beta</tt>, the two components modulo <tt>p</tt>.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">{"alpha": "72348234202340223423", "beta": "123498235234234234324" }</div>

<h4>Voter</h4>

<p>
    A single voter in Helios is represented using a few fields that identify the voter:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">{"email": "benadida@gmail.com", "name": "Ben Adida",
"voter_id": "agxoZWxpb3N2b3RpbmdyCwsSBVZvdGVyGCcM"}</div>

<p>
    The <tt>voter_id</tt> is unique across all elections hosted at this particular Helios server.
</p>

<p>
    Voters may be identified by OpenID URL rather than email address, in which case their JSON representation is:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">{"name": "Ben Adida", "openid": "http://benadida.myopenid.com",
"voter_id": "agxoZWxpb3N2b3RpbmdyCwsSBVZvdGVyGCcM"}</div>

<p>
    Once a voter has cast a ballot, their JSON representation is augmented with their encrypted vote:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">{"name": "Ben Adida", "openid": "http://benadida.myopenid.com",
"vote" : &lt;ENCRYPTED_VOTE&gt;,
"voter_id": "agxoZWxpb3N2b3RpbmdyCwsSBVZvdGVyGCcM"}</div>

<p>We describe the details of the <tt>&lt;ENCRYPTED_VOTE&gt;</tt> data structure later in this document, once we have described all of the required components.</p>
