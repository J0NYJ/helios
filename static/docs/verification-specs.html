<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    Helios is an open-audit voting system, which means that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Alice can verify that her vote was correctly captured,</li>
    <li> all captured votes are displayed (in encrypted form) for all to see, and</li>
    <li> anyone can verify that the captured votes were correctly tallied.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This document specifies all data formats and the exact verification protocols and algorithms. Using this document, it should be possible for an able programmer to build a complete verification program in any modern programming language. For the sake of concreteness, each step in this document is illustrated using Python (2.3 or above.)
