<h1 id="title">Helios Verification Specifications</h1>
by Ben Adida.
<hr />

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    Helios is an open-audit voting system, which means that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Alice can verify that her vote was correctly captured,</li>
    <li> all captured votes are displayed (in encrypted form) for all to see, and</li>
    <li> anyone can verify that the captured votes were correctly tallied.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This document specifies all data formats and the exact verification protocols and algorithms. Using this document, it should be possible for an able programmer to build a complete verification program in any modern programming language. For the sake of concreteness, each step in this document is illustrated using Python (2.3 or above.)
</p>

<h3>Data Formats</h3>

<p>
    We begin with a description of the data types and their representations. All data made available by Helios is in <a href="http://json.org">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a> format, with keys in alphabetical order and no extraneous whitespace other than that specified by JSON. For example:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">{"email": ["ben@adida.net", "ben@mit.edu"], "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Adida"}
</div>

<h4>Basic Cryptographic Datatypes</h4>

<p>
    All large integers are represented in decimal form as strings, rather than integers. (The reason is that some languages do not support big integers natively, and thus cannot properly parse large integers in JSON integer form.) For example:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">{"p": "109123071234023421012301240124234023423432423432232502523078237423"}</div>

<p>
    An El-Gamal public-key is then a dictionary including the prime <tt>p</tt>, the primer-order <tt>q</tt> of its intended subgroup, the generator <tt>g</tt>, and the public-key value <tt>y</tt> (but of course with keys in alphabetical order):
</p>

<div class="codeblock">{"g": "6811145128679259384514506369165", "p": "16998971978194099593503959",
"q": "8499485989097049796751", "y": "7464668703479877164253720373259704"}</div>
